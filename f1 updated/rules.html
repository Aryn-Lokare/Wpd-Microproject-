        <p>1. Qualifying Form : Formula 1 qualifying consists of three sessions (Q1, Q2, Q3), with each session eliminating the slowest cars until a final shootout determines the grid order.</p>
        <br>
        <p>>2.Grid Penalties: Drivers can receive grid penalties for various infractions, such as exceeding their engine allocation or causing avoidable accidents. These penalties push them down the grid order.</p>
        <br>
        <p>3.Points System: Points are awarded to the top 10 finishers in each race, with the winner receiving 25 points, followed by 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1 point(s) for the subsequent positions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>4. DRS (Drag Reduction System):DRS allows drivers to open a flap on their rear wing to reduce drag and increase straight-line speed. It can only be used in designated DRS zones when a driver is within one second of the car ahead.</p>
        <br>
        <p>5. Formation Lap: Before the race starts, drivers complete a formation lap to warm up their tires and brakes. They must maintain their positions relative to each other until reaching the starting grid.</p>
        <br>
        <p>6. Race Start: The race begins with a standing start or, in some cases, a rolling start behind the safety car in wet conditions. Drivers must adhere to strict rules regarding positioning and behavior at the start.</p>
        <br>
        <p>7.Blue Flags: When a driver is about to be lapped by a faster car, blue flags are shown to inform them to yield and allow the faster car to pass safely.</p>
        <br>
        <p>8. Track Limits: Drivers must stay within the track limits defined by white lines. Exceeding these limits can result in time penalties or disqualification if done repeatedly.</p>
        <br>
        <p>9. Safety Car: Deployed when there is a significant incident or hazardous conditions on the track. All cars must follow the safety car at reduced speed and can't overtake until it returns to the pits.</p>
        <br>
        <p>10. Virtual Safety Car (VSC): Similar to the safety car, but instead of deploying a physical car on track, drivers must maintain a specified lap time. Overtaking is prohibited during VSC periods.</p>
        <br>
        <p>11. Minimum Weight: Each car must weigh at least a specified minimum weight, including the driver and all onboard systems. Cars are weighed before and after the race to ensure compliance.</p>
        <br>
        <p>12. Parc Fermé: After qualifying and the race, cars are taken to parc fermé conditions where no significant changes can be made, except under strict guidelines from race stewards.</p>
        <br>
        <p>13. Flags: Various flags are used to communicate with drivers during the race, including yellow flags for caution, a red flag to stop the race, and a black flag for disqualification.</p>
        <br>
        <p>14. Pit Stops: Teams can make pit stops during the race to change tires, make adjustments, or address mechanical issues. Pit stops must adhere to strict safety and speed limits.</p>
        <br>
        <p>15. Drive-Through Penalty: A penalty where a driver must enter the pit lane and drive through it at the prescribed speed without stopping. It is usually imposed for minor infractions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>16. Chequered Flag: Indicates the end of the race. The race winner crosses the finish line when the chequered flag is waved, signaling the conclusion of the Grand Prix.</p>
