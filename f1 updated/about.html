      <h1>What is F1 ?</h1>
      <p>As the highest class of international racing for single-seater formula racing cars, Formula 1<br> the pinnacle of motorsport and the world’s most prestigious motor racing competition.<br> There really is nothing like it. It’s a team sport (it needs to be to change all 4 tyres on a car in under 2 seconds!),<br> but the drivers are more like fighter pilots than sportspeople. Battling extreme g-forces, making daring decisions in the blink of an eye <br> and at 370km/h. To be the best, F1 drivers push themselves – and their incredibly innovative machines – to the very limit.</p>

<h1>When did Formula 1 start?</h1>
<p>Formula 1 was formed as a world championship competition back in 1950, with the first-ever race held at <br> the Silverstone Circuit a former Royal Air Force station – in the United Kingdom on May 13 of that year.  <br>Six more events were staged in a season which saw Alfa Romeo driver <br> Giuseppe ‘Nino’ Farina become the sport’s first world champion  <br> edging out team mates Juan Manuel Fangio and Luigi Fagioli. While motorsport had been taking place since the late-1800s <br>, with Grand Prix events growing in popularity across the following decades, 1950  <br>marked the start of the official F1 championship that remains to this day.</p>

<h1>How long do F1 races last?</h1>
<p>Formula 1 races generally last between an hour-and-a-half and two hours, though this can be impacted by Safety Car periods that slow the field down or red flags that halt the action – see the 2023 Australian Grand Prix as a prime example. Each race on the calendar has a set number of laps based on the length of their respective circuit. The distance of each race is almost always equal to the fewest number of laps that exceed 305 kilometres.  Monaco is an exception to the rule, where the race length is equal to the fewest number of laps needed to exceed a distance of 260km, given the lower speeds of its street circuit nature.</p>
