  <u><h1>1.Lewis Hamilton</h1></u>
    <p>First race: 2007 Australian Grand Prix</p>
    <p> World Championships: 7 (2008, 2014-15, 2017-20) </p> 
       <p>Number of races: 332</p>
       <p>Number of wins: 103</p>
      <p>Number of pole positions: 104</p>
      <p>Career points: 4639.5 </p>
      <p align="left">In terms of career wins and total career points, Lewis Hamilton is the best Formula 1 driver to have ever graced a circuit. The Brit has taken wins in 30 different countries, won a race in almost every season he’s competed in, and is currently tied on world championships with Michael SchumacherWhile he missed becoming champion in his first season by a single point, he became the (then) youngest world champion the following year. Fourteen years later he’s secured six more titles, and is hunting for an eighth. </p>

    <u><h1> 2. Michael Schumacher</h1></u>
    <p>First race: 1991 Belgian Grand Prix
      <p> World Championships:  7 (1994-95, 2000-04) </p> 
       <p>Number of races: 308</p>
       <p>Number of wins: 91</p>
      <p>Number of pole positions: 68</p>
      <p>Career points: 1566 </p>
      <p align="left"> When considering the best F1 driver, Michael Schumacher immediately springs to mind. He was, until the rise of Hamilton, the face of domination in Formula 1: seven titles (five of them consecutive), a seemingly insurmountable number of wins, unrelenting competitiveness – Schumacher changed the game in F1 with his combination of dedication, passion, and, of course, raw talent.While he took two titles with Benetton, he’s far more well-known for his time with Ferrari</p>

    <u><h1> 3.Max Verstappen </h1></u>
    <p>First race: 2007 Australian Grand Prix</p>
    <p> World Championships:  3 (2021, 2022, 2023) </p> 
       <p>Number of races: 185</p>
       <p>Number of wins: 54</p>
      <p>Number of pole positions: 32</p>
      <p>Career points: 2586.5 </p>
       <p align="left">Max Verstappen, son of former Formula 1 driver Jos, spent just one year in car racing before making his F1 debut. While he got to grips with the single-seaters in the Florida Winter Series, his junior career is best remembered for his 2014 European Formula 3 campaign when he finished third in the championship behind Tom Blomqvist and title-winner Esteban Ocon. This single season, in which he took 10 wins from 32 races, including six consecutive wins, was enough to earn him the move up to F1, taking a seat at Red Bull sister team Toro Rosso for 2015 and becoming the youngest-ever grand prix driver. </p>
